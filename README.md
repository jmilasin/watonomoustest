# watonomoustest

## Program Description
This program was designed for the WATonomous Coding Challenge (Winter 2018). The program employs a random number generator to select a number between 0 and 10, and prompts the user to guess the correct number. It checks for junk input and handles it appropriately, as well as doing bounds-checking so that numbers aren’t above 10 or below 0. As the program is simple it exists in one file only.

#### How to run
Run `./script.sh` to build, lint, and run the code.

## Why DevOps is important to WATonomous
DevOps is important to WATonomous because software development is at the core of what the team and project is about. As many complex systems interact and communicate with each other, maintaining clear and consistent interfaces to enable this communication is a necessity to the team’s objectives. There are many individuals involved with the project from various skillsets and the members of the team change frequently; therefore it is important to establish principles and guidelines related to the development of systems related to the autonomous vehicle ensuring everyone has a good understanding of what systems interact and extend their code. By using tools like cpplint, documenting code and ensuring it is up to date, as well as communicating with other members of the team to perform tasks such as pair-programming or code-review, the code-base becomes more rich and complete. These efforts significantly reduce the amount of time spent on debugging and troubleshooting, and most importantly, follow industry best practices for software development, something especially noteworthy in real-time systems such as autonomous vehicles.
